# Soft Kitty Overview

**Soft Kitty** is a collection of professional Unity tools designed to help developers build high-quality games efficiently—without getting buried in low-level implementation details.

The goal of Soft Kitty is simple:\
**let developers focus on game design and creativity, while the framework handles the heavy lifting.**

---

### Philosophy

Modern game development demands both **speed** and **quality**.
However, achieving polished results in Unity often requires deep engine knowledge, extensive custom tooling, and years of experience across multiple disciplines.

Soft Kitty is built to close that gap.

Every system is designed with:

- Item Clear structure and predictable behavior

- Item Production-ready workflows

- Item Strong editor tooling and visual feedback

- Item Performance-conscious runtime design

The result is a set of tools that feel approachable for new developers, yet powerful and flexible enough for experienced teams.

---

### A Modular, Unified Ecosystem

Soft Kitty is not a collection of isolated assets.
It is an **ecosystem**.

Each package is designed to:

- Item Work independently when needed

- Item Integrate cleanly with other Soft Kitty systems

- Item Share consistent concepts, data structures, and workflows

As your project grows, Soft Kitty grows with it—scaling from small prototypes to complex, feature-rich games without forcing rewrites or architectural changes.

---

### Built From Real Production Experience

Soft Kitty is shaped by long-term, hands-on experience across:

- Item Programming

- Item Technical art

- Item Game art

- Item Tool development

- Item Performance optimization

This cross-disciplinary background influences every design decision—from API structure to editor UX—ensuring the tools solve **real production problems**, not just theoretical ones.

### What You’ll Find in This Documentation

This documentation serves as the central reference for the Soft Kitty ecosystem, including:

- Item Core shared systems (Entities, Attributes, Over-Time Effects, etc.)

- Item Package-specific documentation

- Item Concept explanations and best practices

- Item PI references embedded directly within each system

- Item Guides for extending and customizing the framework

Each section is structured to be readable independently, while still fitting into the larger whole—much like the Unity Manual itself.

---

### Looking Ahead

Soft Kitty is actively evolving.
New systems, deeper integrations, and expanded tooling will continue to build toward a cohesive, professional-grade framework for Unity development.
